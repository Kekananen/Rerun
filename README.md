# Rerun
Goal: *Quick comparison of bacterial strain function utalizing improved annotations from dynamic threshold ajustments.* 

Limitations: 
- Will only look at gain of function and not loss.
- Will be limited by annotation databases used.
- May not be comprehensive enough to infer strain level phenotype changes based solely on pathway completness.
- Does not take into account protien structures.
- The developer (myself) will be using this as a way to learn Rust so the code may be more buggy than normal.
